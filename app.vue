          a fan-made, Star Wars themed overhaul of Dungeons and Dragons 5th
          edition. It's still a work in progress, but I've been running a
          campaign for almost a year now, and it's been an absolute blast. The
          Star Wars universe is the perfect blend of High Fantasy (Jedi, Sith,
          the Force) and Low Sci-Fi (analog switches, rusty ships, clunky
          droids). As a D&D setting, the Star Wars universe offers a rich canvas
          for the same run-and-gun, "out of the frying pan, into the fire"
          action of the original trilogy. If you love classic D&D, (or Star
          Wars, for that matter!), definitely check it out
